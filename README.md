# Android-Image-Classification

# Introduction:

The following document describe a mini project to build an Android application with backend service for image recognition, the application responsible of sending an image to the backend service which will do the image recognition and response with the results.
The application is using HTTPS to authenticate the server and API seceret key to authenticate the user. We're using the known model resnet for the image classification

# How to use

* For first time the user has to add an API key to access the application and it will be saved in the phone (Shared Preferences). The API key is saved in the backend server and you can change it.  
* Then you can upload images using the camera directly or by choosing an image from the media

Make sure to change the IP to your backend IP
